Hello Cocoapods
================
A UI done with Storyboard and [Cocoapods][5] for dependency management.

### URL Schemes integrated
Please check [this][4] page in iOS device with this application installed to view URL Schemes in action.

### Networking
 As [RestKit][7] is having some known bugs, it not worth spending time fixing that. Rather [Alamofire][6] is ground up in Swift. 
 
 - [RestKit][7] uses AFNetworking under the hood
 - [Alamofire][6] is used for networking
